# RAG Experiment with LangChain + AI

This repository is a simple experiment to learn and implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and AI tools.

## Overview
- Demonstrates basic RAG concepts
- Uses LangChain for retrieval and generation
- Includes sample code and data for experimentation
- Uses a list of EV stations in India as sample data (CSV format), handled with Pandas

## Files
- `main.py`: Main script for running the experiment
- `vector.py`: Vector operations and database handling
- `ev_final.csv`: Sample data for retrieval
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `chroma_langchain_db/`: Chroma database files

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Purpose
This project is for educational purposes only, to explore RAG workflows with LangChain and AI.
